--------
Forker's Note
----
Original code: https://archive.xfce.org/src/panel-plugins/xfce4-cpugraph-plugin/1.2/xfce4-cpugraph-plugin-1.2.3.tar.bz2
I downloaded the archive, did some trials and errors until it works.

This currently only works on Linux. I copied code and modified some parts
from xfce4-systemload-plugin into this. Note that this is very unoptimized
as I only modified the read cpu usage into reading memory usage.

The plugin icon is from Vimix-Dark.
